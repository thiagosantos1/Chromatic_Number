Assignment #5:
h1:
h2:
-1/2 Not the bubble-sort algorithm.
h3:
 -1/2 Your load dictionary function consumes huge amounts of memory beyond
  what it needs to for each string it stores.  Use strdup() to duplicate
  strings.
h4:
h5:
-1/2 Have your passwd/group structures mixed up:
  h5.c: In function 'printuser':
  h5.c:89:25: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
       struct group *grp = getpwuid(uid);
              ^ should be passwd
  h5.c: In function 'printgroup':
  h5.c:106:26: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
       struct passwd *pwd = getgrgid(gid);
              ^ should be group

  - Amazing works because the first member of both structures is a string and
    you lucked out as that is all you needed.  In the future, don't ignore
    warnings.

bonus1: +4

bonus2: +1/2
 +1/2 Doesn't appear to work, but the binary search is in there.  Not sure why
   bubble sort is, the dictionary is already sorted.
