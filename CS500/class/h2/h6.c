/**
 * Create a global character array containing the string:
 *   "nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm"
 * And read characters from the standard input and convert them all to lower-
 * case using the tolower() function.  Use the global character array to map
 * the characters a-z to the characters in the array, (i.e. 'a' should map to
 * 'n', 'b' to 'o', etc.) and print the character it maps to instead of the
 * original.
 * 
 * Example input/output:
 * ./h6
 * test
 * grfg
