/**
 * Create a program that takes zero or more paths on the command line (and
 * defaults to "." if one is not provided) and recursively lists the files and
 * directories in those paths and prints at the end a report of how much space
 * (in bytes) is used by all of the files and directories and finally a tally
 * of how many files and directories were encountered.
 * Example input/output:
 * > ./h6 /u1/junk/cs151
 * /u1/junk/cs151
 * /u1/junk/cs151/fstab
 * /u1/junk/cs151/hosts
 * /u1/junk/cs151/rgb.txt
 * /u1/junk/cs151/services
 * /u1/junk/cs151/words
 * 
 * Total bytes = 468487
 * 0 directories, 5 files
