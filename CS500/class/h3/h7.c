/**
 * Make a program that takes a single integer command line argument (n) and
 * makes a n x n multiplication table resembling the 4x4 example below. It
 * should accept numbers between 1 and 12, but no smaller or larger.  If there
 * are not enough arguments it should print a usage:
 *   Usage: h7 <n>\n
 * and exit, and if n is out of range it should print:
 *   n out of range (1-12)\n
 * and exit.  All numbers are right-aligned to 4 characters.
 *
 * Example input/output:
 * ./h7 4
 *    *    1   2   3   4
 *     +----------------
 *    1|   1   2   3   4
 *    2|   2   4   6   8
 *    3|   3   6   9  12
 *    4|   4   8  12  16
