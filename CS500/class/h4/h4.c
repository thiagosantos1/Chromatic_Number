/**
 * This program takes a file-name from the command line and prints it out 5
 * lines at a time, numbering the lines of the output as it goes (line numbers
 * should be three characters wide, right-aligned). Every five lines print it
 * should stop and print a prompt "MORE? " and read a line from the standard
 * input.  If the first letter of the users input is a 'q' or a 'Q', then quit
 * the program, otherwise print the next five lines.
 *
 * Example input/output:
 * ./h4 test/h3-testa 
 *   1 Test A
 *   2 Test B
 *   3 Test C
 *   4 Test D
 *   5 Test E
 * MORE? q
