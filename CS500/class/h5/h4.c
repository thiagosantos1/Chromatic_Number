 * Re-use the load_dictionary() function from h3.c
 */


/**
 * Create a main function that takes a file-name on the command line and 
 * reads words out of the file (use fscanf() to do this) and checks each word
 * to see if it's in the loaded dictionary.  Again use strcasecmp() to do a
 * case-insensitive search.
 * Example input/output:
 * ./h4 testfile 
 * 'Bob'   OK
 * 'Tiffany'       NOT FOUND
 * 'Steve' NOT FOUND
 * 'Jim'   NOT FOUND
 * ...
