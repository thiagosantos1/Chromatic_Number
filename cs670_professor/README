A good problem to use to get started:

  problem040: the chromatic number is 6
  problem080: the chromatic number is 5

A hard problem:

  problem165: the chromatic number is 3 (3-colorings are hard to find)
  problem216: the chromatic number is 4

Check the modification times for the log files in this directory.  This
was the problem started in class with 24 processes.  It finished halfway
through the next class.

A very hard problem:

  problem203: the chromatic number is 5 (5-colorings are hard to find)

The last problem took 5 days on 200+ processors.  The program that was
used is the fastest program I know about.  It was developed in Belgium
at the University of Ghent.  The graph is one that I found several years
ago for a different problem.  The computer used at Ghent to find the
coloring is a bit faster than our CS server (maybe 20% faster per core).
