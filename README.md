# Concurrent_Programming
Repository for my projects of Class 670 - Concurrent Programming

In this class, we create optimtized solutions, like coloring graph(NP Hard). After having a reasonable solution working in single-process, we aim to accelerate it by improviing our solution to Multithread. 

The main File has name choramtic.c in all folders.
