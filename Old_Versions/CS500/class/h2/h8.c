/**
 * Write a program that reads characters from the standard input and places
 * them into a character buffer if they are a number or if it's a minus sign
 * and is the first character to go in the buffer, and as long as you read
 * numbers, keep adding them to the buffer.  For any other character encountered
 * use the atoi() function and add the integer number to a sum and start over.
 * 
 * When all the characters have been read, print the sum of all the numbers.
 * 
 * Example input/output:
 * ./h8 < Makefile
 * 169
